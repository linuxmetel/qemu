================================================
Patched QEMU for Debugging High Definition Audio
================================================

You can read the README from the upstream in `README.upstream.rst <README.upstream.rst>`_.

This is based on `jcs-hda-dma from jcs/qemu <https://github.com/jcs/qemu/tree/jcs-hda-dma>`_. However, this have been no longer maintained, so I created this repository. 

Building
========

Please see the `upstream README <README.upstream.rst#building>`_.

Usage
=====

Please see the `wiki <https://github.com/linuxmetel/qemu/wiki/debugging-hda>`_.


Sync with the upstream
======================

I will sync this repository so that it would keeps as up-to-date as `<the Arch Linux packages https://archlinux.org/packages/?sort=&arch=x86_64&repo=Extra&q=qemu->`_ is (Why Arch Linux? Hmm, maybe it is because Arch Linux is the best Linux distribution on the earth.) However, I may forget to sync this repository, so please create issue to inform me if you notice that it have been long out-of-date.
